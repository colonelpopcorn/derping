# Notes for the Haskell Programming Language

All my notes while I'm learning Haskell can go here. Any notes on specific technologies in the Haskell Programming Language sphere can go into individual readme files in the folders for that technology.

Function bodies are kind of ok, I guess, but I need to make this example more robust with functions invoked from CLI args. Very basic function body looks like this:

```haskell
-- doubleMe is function name and everything that comes after it but before equals sign is argument
doubleMe x = x + x 
-- Then everything after the equals sign is the function body itself. This helps write concise one-line functions.
-- Not really sure how to write more complex functions, yet.
```
